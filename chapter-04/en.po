#. Context: And thus are two sons made, and both appear to walk this earth
#. without a meeting place and no encounter. One do you perceive outside
#. yourself, your own beloved son. The other rests within, his Father’s Son,
#. within your brother as he is in you. Their difference does not lie in how
#. they look, nor where they go, nor even what they do. They have a different
#. purpose. It is this that joins them to their like, and separates each from
#. all aspects with a different purpose. The Son of God retains his Father’s
#. will. The son of man perceives an alien will and wishes it were so.[1]

#. Context: Simultaneously, however, the eternal spiritual presence, the I AM,

#. Context: Like most people, Bill presumed he was organizing his life

#. and finally closes, but not before he demonstrates how to lay aside the
#. quest for the “best of both worlds”—that unsatisfactory mix of love and
#. fear—to pursue the single goal of peace of mind. He also makes it clear
#. that you can be “in the world but not of it” and accomplish the only feat
#. that really matters—waking up.

#. Context: Bill was a shy and private man, and all those who knew him are

#. what is possible when one chooses to practice the Course teachings.

#. history. His life is representative of everyone’s, and the steps he took
#. reveal those we must take, if we would be healed. This document is less a

#. not. Therefore, to honor what would certainly be Bill’s request, I present
#. him here as a beloved equal, a dear friend, and unwitting mentor to so
#. many. One wonders if he ever totally realized how greatly he touched
#. others. In discussing this gift with him, in true egalitarian fashion he

#. Context: Of all forms of recognition, Bill most objected to being
#. sanctified or put on a pedestal. In the early days, some ACIM teachers were
#. inclined to do just that. He used to laugh about his response to situations
#. where he thought he had been unduly elevated, saying, “When they started
#. that, I’d just have to smoke cigarettes and say ‘shit’!” Now, he would want
#. people to know his shortcomings and not evade issues he found challenging.
#. Although he insisted on seeing himself as ordinary, most of his friends did
#. not. Therefore, to honor what would certainly be Bill’s request, I present
#. him here as a beloved equal, a dear friend, and unwitting mentor to so
#. many. One wonders if he ever totally realized how greatly he touched
#. others. In discussing this gift with him, in true egalitarian fashion he
#. would ask us to apply that same question to our own lives. And so we
#. should.

#. Context: One time years ago, when Bill was at my home in Denver, he

#. in the world seemed a mystery, so we agreed to wait and see what would
#. happen. Years later, in the days after Bill’s passing, I felt the mantle
#. being passed to the next generation, so to speak, and that it was
#. imperative for those of us drawn to the Course to increase our dedication
#. to “walking the talk.” I spent a great deal of time contemplating my

#. Context: During his ten years in California, the last chapter of his life,
#. Bill often told the stories of his youth, his career path, and the
#. circumstances surrounding the scribing of the Course, almost always with a
#. humorous twist. He used to say he would probably tell those stories until
#. he was finally comfortable with them, as if telling and retelling them was
#. a sort of soul-liberating confession. In particular, he often commented
#. that if we thought studying and practicing the Course was difficult, we
#. should have experienced the complications of scribing it. Therefore, we
#. will read his tales from our current vantage point, which allows a more
#. fleshed-out picture of him. I have also included firsthand accounts of his
#. impact on those who knew him, the healings that occurred for so many, as
#. well as my own experience of a precious friendship with him.
