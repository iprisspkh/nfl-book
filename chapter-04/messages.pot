"Obviously, from Bill’s recounting of what the university was like in general"
" and his relationships with Helen and others in particular, he was "
"projecting his own “shadow side,” his long-held fears and grievances, into "
"his situation there. Every beginning ACIM student learns that the subjective"
" experience of one’s outer circumstances faithfully reflects an inner state "
"of mind. Stated more bluntly, the more guilt one carries, even though "
"unconsciously, the more one feels punished by outer conditions. Bill "
"certainly contributed to the problems in his environment as he projected his"
" own judgments, fears, unconscious conditioning, and unexamined assumptions "
"about how life should be into the situation, as do we all. He knew about "
"projection theoretically—the process of seeing in others what we fear to own"
" in ourselves—but clearly knew little about dealing with that process "
"personally. Despite his talents, training, and potential, he was as sound "
"asleep as the rest of us. Early in ACIM’s text, one finds, “Yet the Bible "
"says that a deep sleep fell upon Adam, and nowhere is there reference to his"
