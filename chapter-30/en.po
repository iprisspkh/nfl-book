#. Context: While in this world, Bill finally wanted only to be ordinary and
#. to find sameness with everyone. Only if we are the same does his story have
#. meaning for us. If we change just a few details, we recognize our own
#. journey in his and can see that his answers are also ours. It is true that
#. Bill possessed talents and assets that many of us don’t have, making many
#. facets of his life easier than for most. However, those assets of privilege
#. were paired with challenges that would have broken the spirits of many. He
#. was an amazing human being, but he was human. As I am sure he would
#. earnestly want to convey, the traits he cultivated, the ones that led him
#. home, are well within everyone’s reach: a daily, steadfast determination to
#. let go of conflict—the ego’s sustenance—and willingness to make peace of
#. mind the primary goal for each encounter. We need his human example to see
#. that we’re not asked to sacrifice in practicing forgiveness. His life
#. demonstrates that it is worth it. We do need to relinquish our defenses,
#. attachments, and valueless investments, though not necessarily our worldly
#. possessions if they aid with our gifts of service. We cherish our
#. grievances rather than each other, as if they were precious heirlooms, but
#. we can change our minds. If Bill had a profound mission, so do we. As he
#. liberated his light, presence, and joy, so will we.
