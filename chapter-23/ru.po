#. Context: It is evident by now that Bill’s hallmarks were his almost
#. unparalleled ability to accept and support others and his fabulous sense of
#. humor inviting everyone to lighten up. Their effect was healing—of body and
#. spirit—both for Bill and those around him. There was often no conscious
#. discussion of or focus on healing; it just happened. For some, it was
#. merely being in his presence, for others it was hearing his voice; but in
#. other cases, he intended for healing to occur. He never stated directly
#. what he thought ought to be healed in a person. Layle Luckett remembers,
#. “One thing I learned about myself during that process is that there is a
#. wonderful indirect way of teaching [and healing]. Bill would usually tell
#. us some story that would illustrate a point. For instance, he would never
#. say, ‘Forgive your mother,’ but he’d talk about some instance of
#. forgiveness.”[70]
