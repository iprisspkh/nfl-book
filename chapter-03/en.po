#. Context: My journey (Jerry) with Bill and Carol began in 1978 when she

#. of us were together that he was impressed with her. I was not surprised
#. when he started visiting her in Denver and know that being there was a kind
#. of escape for him. I (Diane) met Carol in 1982 when she was in Tiburon and
#. also recognized that she and Bill had a unique relationship. Little did any
#. of us know at that time all the ways our lives would be intertwined over
#. the years or just where our work would take us.

#. Context: This book is not simply a biography, but a body of work that
#. integrates the facts of Bill’s life with Course teachings and the personal
#. reflections of more than thirty friends in a way that creates a unique and
#. meaningful experience for the reader. Bill was a man of opposites and
#. contradictions who did not fall neatly into categories. He was also a very
#. private person and in reading Carol’s account of his life, we discovered
#. many things about him that we did not know despite our close friendship and
#. all the years we spent together. That was a heart-warming experience for
#. us. As those of us who were there in the beginning of ACIM history continue
#. to age, there is a sense of urgency to put our experiences and insights on
#. paper so that others may learn from them. We are grateful Carol has chosen
#. to do so in regard to Bill’s life.

#. Context: [1]A Course In Miracles is a self-study course in three parts: a
#. text, a workbook, and a manual for teachers. Its basic hypothesis is that
#. we are conditioned from birth to a limited way of perceiving and our
#. “understanding” of life is a product of past conditioning. Practicing the
#. workbook lessons undoes our negative, unhelpful, inaccurate view of people,
#. situations, and events, resulting in a different perception of the world.
#. As Course practice proceeds, the fearful ideas we have learned are
#. systematically replaced with an alternative viewpoint—happier, more
#. spiritual, and all-encompassing. Later lessons are designed to evoke a
#. direct spiritual experience and greater love for self and others.
