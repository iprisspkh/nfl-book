"complete, he was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency, the country’s"
" newly reorganized intelligence service. All of Bill’s education and "
"training up to that point had involved working with leading-edge scientists,"

" well known, and publishing is always an integral and necessary aspect of "
"academia, he had become widely recognized and respected throughout his field"
" as a result of his own publications and others to which he contributed. "

"the CIA operates, indicated they had levels of connections back then, far "
"beyond what we might imagine, to identify potential recruits who could prove"
" useful to the Agency. Clearly, Bill fell into the “useful” category."
