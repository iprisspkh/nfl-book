"About the time Bill felt his interesting work opportunities in Chicago were "
"complete, he was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency, the country’s"
" newly reorganized intelligence service. All of Bill’s education and "
"training up to that point had involved working with leading-edge scientists,"
" innovators in science and medicine. Because his mentors and colleagues were"
" well known, and publishing is always an integral and necessary aspect of "
"academia, he had become widely recognized and respected throughout his field"
" as a result of his own publications and others to which he contributed. "
"Thus, he was also easy to track, even before the age of computers and "
"modern-day surveillance. A friend of mine and Bill’s, conversant with how "
"the CIA operates, indicated they had levels of connections back then, far "
"beyond what we might imagine, to identify potential recruits who could prove"
" useful to the Agency. Clearly, Bill fell into the “useful” category."

"Although I cannot prove beyond doubt—either through interviews with key "

"tried this route)—it seems obvious that the CIA and John Gittinger were "
"again maneuvering behind the scenes to place Bill in this important post, as"

"supported this hypothesis; Bill believed the Agency had a hand in arranging "
"his various career opportunities. It especially makes sense given the "
"Agency’s propensity to develop a person’s strengths, to push them along, so "
"to speak. Gittinger told Dr. Marshall Heyman, another former CIA colleague "
"of Bill’s, that Bill and later Helen were the only two “outsiders” (non-CIA "
