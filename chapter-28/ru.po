#. Context: On the last weekend Bill and Jo spent together, he had declared
#. his intention to take more risks, expand his reach, and be ever more true
#. to himself. The time for wearing a mask was over. My favorite mantra is,
#. “When all else fails, tell the truth,” and Bill now adopted this fully. We
#. have been conditioned to do everything else but that, having learned our
#. manipulating and negotiating skills at a very early age. As with all of us,
#. Bill’s imprisonment began in childhood; with each grievance he collected,
#. another imaginary bar was installed, creating the subjective experience of
#. an unshared, lonely prison. But with each choice to change his mind, a bar
#. vanished, and he felt more powerful, integrated, secure, confident, and
#. able to access his inborn wisdom. He was in charge of the prison doors and
#. could use his talents to gain his freedom.

#. Frances [Vaughan]. About the time people would be reading their program
#. notes, some ladies came through; if you were at a ballgame you would say
#. they were hotdog and beer hawkers. But these were very straight, ethereal-
#. looking, ballerina-type ladies and they were handing out chocolate sundaes,

#. sundaes, but those coffee-crunch things you could put on top, which he also
#. loved. I thought this was very strange, but they were very good and I
#. noticed that he was eating his. About the time you would expect the
#. overture to begin, Bill stood up from his chair, turned around to face us,
#. and said, “I have come full circle in my life. All the things that I didn’t
#. understand, all the things I was afraid to say, I now want to share with

#. moved absolutely everybody. Knowing how he hated to speak in public and the
#. anxiety it caused him, the relaxation with which he delivered this truth of
#. his life was an incredible thing to behold. When he was finished, Frances,

#. but this was a totally new dimension of this person that we all loved so
#. much. Nobody applauded but when he finished, everybody stood up with tears

#. gather in small clumps or groups and began to tell each other the truth of
#. their lives with the same utter defenselessness, vulnerability, and trust
#. that he had exhibited when he stood and talked with us. I saw Bill beaming
#. down on absolutely everyone at what he had set in motion. That was the end
#. of the dream. The next morning when I awakened, I was in a joyful state. I
#. knew that Bill had come to something in his life that was totally freeing,
