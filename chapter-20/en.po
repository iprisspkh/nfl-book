#. Context: So what were the issues he struggled with? The same as
#. ours—grievances, of course, and feelings of guilt and failure, as well as
#. the defenses that hide the pain and distress they cause. Despite his
#. outward demeanor and his obvious loving nature, he still had some long-held
#. notions about himself to release. Bill may have been kind to others, but he
#. was hard on himself, troubled by perceived deficiencies. It’s amazing that
#. he could have had such a profound effect on others while still battling
#. with his own guilt, testimony to the two starkly different modes of living
#. in this world. Just as Helen could alternate between polar opposites—bowing
#. to her difficult, demanding ego and accessing the love that created the
#. Course—Bill, too, could operate from an unconditional loving space or be
#. caught in the grip of self-doubt. And just as ACIM dictation was not
#. compromised when Helen didn’t feel good, so too, love is present along with
#. confusion about lack of worth.

#. Context: There are three avenues we can use to discern the challenging
#. aspects of Bill’s interior life. First is the direct material in the Urtext
#. that addresses both his assessment of his unworthiness and the defenses he
#. employed to cope with it. The purpose of the Course is to illustrate how to
#. release entirely the notion of unworthiness, rather than provide more
#. sophisticated strategies for keeping and dealing with it. Second,
#. throughout his life, Bill elicited certain behavior patterns in others,
#. which allows great insight into what he feared or found troubling in
#. himself, although perhaps unconsciously. “Unacceptable” behaviors in
#. others, of course, reflect our own unfinished business and condemnation of
#. ourselves. Third, he specifically commented on certain characteristics he
#. found objectionable in himself and others; no detective work required here.

#. Helen and not to Jesus. Helen had her own biases about sex, and
#. unfortunately they came through in these early passages. Yet those who
#. believe that every word in the Urtext is sacred and are Jesus’ words can
#. use statements like these to support their own preconceived notions. This
#. same issue holds, though perhaps with less emotionality, with material

#. Context: These observations include several critically important ideas.
#. First, we all know individuals who take up a great deal of psychic space,
#. who seem to take all the air out of a room, who dominate with “I, me, and
#. mine—it’s all about me.” No one warms to that person and yet we all believe
#. that we require some degree of self-promotion to be happy, secure, and
#. prosperous. However, if you ask someone to elaborate on how that happens,
#. you will not get a valid answer. We have fallen into the trap of believing
#. that taking up space is good and necessary, competing for it through
#. attempts to be special. The philosopher Douglas Harding often speaks of
#. “disappearing in favor of the other person,” another way of stating Bill’s
#. capacity for open acceptance. It seems a paradox that the more
#. wholeheartedly present we are for others, the more we “disappear,” the more
#. everyone gains. This contradicts our earliest programming of how to “stake
#. out our territory.” If we gathered up all the “I, me, and mine” thought
#. patterns and rolled them up to almost nothing—figuratively speaking—our
#. happiness would increase. Focusing on the other, rather than self, is a
#. major component of forgiveness. One caution: taking up no space does not
#. mean withholding, hiding, or defending. Keeping things bottled up for fear
#. of being unacceptable is hardly a no-space situation. Feeling inferior with
#. the need to hide can result in one’s being an irritable, high-maintenance
#. person, indeed.
