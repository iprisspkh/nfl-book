"Speaking of his inclination to study psychology, he often commented that he "

"that nothing really seemed to come of them. He saw no one integrating them "

"has really explained what happens in psychotherapy. Nothing really does. "
"Nothing real has happened to the unhealed healer, and he must learn from his"
