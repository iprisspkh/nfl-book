"As the daily ACIM transcription process stretched into months, then years, "
"Bill and Helen had mused about whether it would ever end, and if so, how "
"they might know that. At first, they thought it would be only a few pages "
"long, but as it continued to unfold, it became clear it was a much longer "

"consists of a text, a workbook, and teacher’s manual,” but they had no way "
"of knowing that early on. When they inquired, the inner Voice told them they"

" Amen. I am consistently moved to tears, imagining that October morning in "

"Thus ends the earthly sojourn of Bill Thetford. The calling card found in "
"his wallet had only Bill Thetford printed on it. Just plain Bill. He asked "
"for the Course; he received it and used it, willingly stripping himself of "
"his persona, psychological armoring, prestige, unhelpful habits, and "
"presumptions. Throughout the process, he danced, laughed and struggled, "
"joked, despaired and supported, loved, feared and prayed, and steadily "
"forgave his way to the end, soaring to a glorious finale worthy of the "
"grandest of operas he so adored. And memories of Bill have settled with "
"everlasting comfort into the hearts of all who knew, loved, and were touched"
" by this most gracious friend."
