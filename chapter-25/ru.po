#. Context: Bill’s ability to turn directly to God manifested, among other
#. ways, in his excellent sense of guidance, his ability to follow his
#. intuition or hunches. The Course clearly states that spiritual direction is
#. always available and actually leading us, but most don’t believe they have
#. that capability. ACIM teaches that, “The Holy Spirit’s Voice is as loud as
#. your willingness to listen. It cannot be louder without violating your
#. freedom of choice, which the Holy Spirit seeks to restore, never to
#. undermine.”[101] Quite simply, we have chosen not to listen and can change
#. our minds whenever we choose. Bill helped many make that decision.

#. possible; he didn’t quite know how to use that talent, not knowing where it

#. or evaluation, so in his younger years he usually ignored it or at least
#. didn’t talk about it. One of the greatest limitations we adopt early on is

#. feeling he was supposed to meet her. “I had also heard she was ill most of

#. Context: It was a highly charged emotional atmosphere. At the beginning,

#. coquettish and, to my mind, inappropriate, especially for her age. She wore
#. a white dress and made little jokes, gradually warming up her audience.
#. This went on for a while, then gradually something began to happen. She
#. became more serious and started talking about the power of spirit. I was
#. aware of the moment when things clicked—changed. She became quite
#. different, another consciousness had taken over. That was presumably what
#. she was waiting for. It takes enormous courage to get up before thousands
#. of people and wait for that to happen. When it happened, there was a
#. feeling of authenticity about it. She was no longer this sort of silly,
#. somewhat hysterical woman, but a power and spirit that somehow came
#. through. When she started calling out healings in various parts of the
#. audience, people would come down and line up. It was amazing; she would
#. just touch people and they would fall over. This went on for hours. Time
#. didn’t seem to make any difference. None of it seemed contrived; it was all
#. quite startling. Some of it may have been suggestion, but I don’t think it
#. was all suggestion. It’s easy to dismiss this kind of thing, but Helen was
#. very moved by it, too. Helen even dropped all of her blasé defensiveness,
#. and I was very touched. We felt a tremendous spiritual power that was
#. generated somehow. Kathryn was acting as a common battery, I guess; she was

#. was very happy that Helen’s intuition was not always reliable. One unusual
#. challenge that weighed on him in his first years away from New York was
#. Helen’s prediction, made around the time ACIM was first published, about
#. when both she and Bill would die; she saw the date on her own tombstone
#. (she was off by a year) and indicated Bill would follow her within a year
#. of her passing. Since she had died in February 1981, everyone, certainly
#. Bill, felt some apprehension as the anniversary date approached. It came
#. and went without incident, and everyone let out a collective sigh of
#. relief; Bill survived Helen by seven and a half years. Ken Wapnick has
#. noted she could be notoriously wrong when she had a personal investment in
#. a prediction. That was her psychic facility misfiring, rather than the
#. Voice that authored ACIM. Only with nonspecific, nonpersonal Course
#. material was she always absolutely clear.
