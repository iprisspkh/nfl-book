"Although Bill was gay, there were women he deeply cared for and considered "
"an integral part of his life, especially after moving to California. I found"
" no evidence from interviews or archival records that there was ever an "
"important woman in his New York life other than Helen. That is not "
"surprising since he always had a male partner while living there and Helen "
"consumed almost all his attention, even during his personal time. It’s a "
"wonder he had time for anything or anyone outside his work and preoccupation"
" with her. One of his good friends characterized him as “ambiguously gay,” "
"and Bill told Jo, his first and only girlfriend, that he considered himself "
"bisexual even though he was not intimate with women. Others opined that he "
"thought and interacted in the world like a straight man but conducted his "
"private life as a gay man. In his high school essay, he wrote of constantly "
"following his sister and her friends around and about his ongoing "
"fascination with the opposite sex, a fascination that apparently continued "
"into adulthood. In the California era, Bill was attracted to a few other "
"women and with them he had the same intimate yet not intimate relationship "
"he and I had as well. We have all been confounded at trying to explain what "
"that relationship was like. Also Bill was concerned that his homosexuality "
"might reflect negatively on ACIM, a sacred trust in his eyes, and spending "

"Additional opportunities for growth were in store for both Bill and me. One "
"morning in January 1979, Jerry called to say that while meditating he had "
"received a “message” that I should join him, Bill, and a third person, "
"Aeesha, to present a day-long seminar on ACIM for the University of "
"California at Santa Cruz, to be held three months later in April. This was a"
" shocking invitation as I had been a Course student for only a year and a "
"half. The Course does indeed present challenges, and this one raised the "
"bar. Looking back, I can’t fathom all I didn’t know then, but somehow, by "
"the end of the day, the seminar seemed to be a success and Bill was greatly "
"relieved. He despised speaking before large groups. He thought a group of "
"five or six was the perfect size; that he enjoyed. However, standing in "
"front of a large group produced great anxiety for him. Not only was public "
"speaking threatening to him, but for his first few years after retirement, "
"he was still trying to avoid notoriety about the Course. His New York "
"friends indicated that he always hated public speaking while living there "
