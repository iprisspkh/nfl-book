#. Context: In the early spring of 1978, I received a brochure from the
#. Association of Humanistic Psychology (as I was not a member, I had never
#. before received a mailing from them, nor did I ever again) about their
#. regional conference to be held in Denver, featuring the publisher of A
#. Course In Miracles, Judith Skutch (Whitson). Most captivating of all, it
#. stated that Bill Thetford would also be there, though not as a presenter. I
#. was thrilled. By that time, I had been a devoted Course student for nine
#. months. I loved it and would have gone to any lengths to meet anyone
#. involved with ACIM, especially Bill or Helen. On the appointed evening, my
#. husband Bob and I arrived at Regis College, the conference location, and
#. were surprised to find folding chairs and a temporary stage set up outside,
#. an ill-considered decision as May evenings in Colorado can be very cold;
#. there had been no mention of an outdoor event in the brochure. We greatly
#. enjoyed Judy’s spirited presentation, which confirmed that ACIM was,
#. indeed, a world-class enterprise, despite no sign of Bill. Since it was
#. growing colder by the minute and I had brought only a lightweight sweater,
#. I left shortly before the end of the presentation and headed for the
#. nearest building.

#. Context: On entering, I saw a tall, attractive man standing alone to one
#. side of a large reception area and instantly knew it was Bill. And in that
#. same instant, looking into those indescribable eyes, I felt an immediate
#. and ancient recognition, a connection unlike any I had ever experienced

#. severalfold on seeing him. I introduced myself, thanking him for all he had
#. done to bring this marvelous work forward. In those delicious ten minutes
#. before everyone else succumbed to the cold and came indoors, I had the
#. opportunity to visit with him but, more important, to be in his powerful
#. yet totally unassuming presence. Words fail here. He seemed to be a man
#. with no mask, no pretense, nothing to hide, and no agenda to pursue, and he
#. made no attempt to be impressive, or anything else, for that matter. He was
#. simply present—a graceful, authentic human being, a rarity in my
#. experience. As we spoke for those few minutes before the crowd discovered
#. him, I was enchanted by his beautiful voice, although I cannot remember a
#. word he said. Anyone fortunate enough to have heard Bill speak, especially
#. in person, knows the healing quality of his lovely bass voice. After we
#. shared a brief good-bye, I rode home in silence, spellbound and intensely
#. moved by this instant heart-to-heart connection with a seeming “stranger.”

#. to study this new work.[3] Little did he know the other reason he needed to

#. officially, he had not yet come out of the ACIM “closet.” Certainly, other
#. psychologists have been involved with “channeling” or have received
