#. Context: Early on in California, a coterie of people began to collect
#. around Bill, all part of a grounding network vital to his continued
#. unfolding, while mutually facilitating the healing for all concerned. The
#. initial support group, consisting of Judy and Bob Skutch and Jerry
#. Jampolsky, was already in place when Bill left New York. With the morning
#. prayer group, Frances and Roger joined the circle and, along with Jules,
#. became central to his anchoring into the area. With careers in psychology
#. and psychiatry, they functioned as colleagues but also became his protégés.
#. Additional members of Bill’s support group, from different places and walks
#. of life, showed up throughout his last ten years in precisely the proper
#. order. Those closest to him were all ACIM students and formed a family of
#. sorts; each provided different yet essential elements for his releasing,
#. healing, comforting, and grounding. The foundation was being laid. Bill had
#. made a commitment to practice the Course’s version of forgiveness and help
#. to do so was coalescing. Of course, he had many wonderful friends,
#. colleagues, and partners during his first fifty-five years, but his goals
#. then had been more worldly and divided; he had not yet fully dedicated
#. himself to a spiritual practice. Additionally, many other friends and
#. acquaintances were part of his California life, important in various ways,
#. and who undoubtedly contributed to his well-being. The Course clearly
#. states that there are no accidents—even the briefest encounter is
#. meaningful and holds the possibility of great healing if we so choose.
#. Nevertheless, Bill, like everyone, was destined to spend more time with
#. some than others.

#. while at Columbia, but had forgotten to apply for his benefits when he
#. retired. When Pat Hopkins (who entered his life later) found out about this
#. in 1984 through a conversation with Cal Hatcher, she helped him apply for

#. a department with a large staff and sizable budget, he was quite detached

"to smoke."

#. Context: Bill took on another challenge when he left New York—to quit
#. smoking. He was a nonstop smoker and quitting was not easy. However, he
#. recognized the need to discontinue the habit, knowing it was preventing
#. long-buried feelings from surfacing. In their stead, he carried cinnamon
#. sticks and chewed on those when tempted to smoke. Bill commented one time
#. that in the hectic New York days, he lived mostly on coffee, which he drank
#. all day long, several packs of cigarettes, and butter pecan ice cream. It’s
#. a wonder he lived as long as he did, especially with a heart damaged by
#. rheumatic fever!

#. Context: Judy, looking out for his best interests, instinctively knew that
#. proceeds from the early sales of the Course would go to support Bill when
#. he retired; his receiving a stipend seemed inevitable and obvious. On the
#. other hand, Bill noted, “I didn’t expect the Course to be a source of
#. financial support. We never thought of that at all. Yet eventually it did
#. happen and it took me a long time even to be comfortable with the idea of
#. living on funds from the Foundation for Inner Peace.”[14] Thus, with his
#. stipend from the Foundation, his pension, investments in the stock market,
#. and his capacity to “manifest as needed,” he always lived comfortably.
