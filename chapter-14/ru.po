#. Context: Early on in California, a coterie of people began to collect
#. around Bill, all part of a grounding network vital to his continued
#. unfolding, while mutually facilitating the healing for all concerned. The
#. initial support group, consisting of Judy and Bob Skutch and Jerry
#. Jampolsky, was already in place when Bill left New York. With the morning
#. prayer group, Frances and Roger joined the circle and, along with Jules,
#. became central to his anchoring into the area. With careers in psychology
#. and psychiatry, they functioned as colleagues but also became his protégés.
#. Additional members of Bill’s support group, from different places and walks
#. of life, showed up throughout his last ten years in precisely the proper
#. order. Those closest to him were all ACIM students and formed a family of
#. sorts; each provided different yet essential elements for his releasing,
#. healing, comforting, and grounding. The foundation was being laid. Bill had
#. made a commitment to practice the Course’s version of forgiveness and help
#. to do so was coalescing. Of course, he had many wonderful friends,
#. colleagues, and partners during his first fifty-five years, but his goals
#. then had been more worldly and divided; he had not yet fully dedicated
#. himself to a spiritual practice. Additionally, many other friends and
#. acquaintances were part of his California life, important in various ways,
#. and who undoubtedly contributed to his well-being. The Course clearly
#. states that there are no accidents—even the briefest encounter is
#. meaningful and holds the possibility of great healing if we so choose.
#. Nevertheless, Bill, like everyone, was destined to spend more time with
#. some than others.
