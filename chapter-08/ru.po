#. Context: Up to this point, the events, training, and circumstances in
#. Bill’s life had conspired to develop his many innate skills and to acquire
#. general life experience. Now the plot thickens. Shortly after his
#. appointment to Columbia, Bill was asked to hire a psychologist with skills
#. in creating instruments to test infants and young children; the position
#. would fulfill the requirements of a grant offered to the university.
#. Although he was certainly knowledgeable in the general field of tests and
#. measurements and had a great deal of experience working with children, he
#. had not designed tests for them and needed a specialist in this area. He
#. checked with a colleague, well known in the field, who promised to help if
#. he could. Shortly thereafter, Bill received a phone call from a woman who
#. introduced herself thus: “My name is Dr. Helen Schucman. I was told to tell

#. Context: Obviously, from Bill’s recounting of what the university was like
#. in general and his relationships with Helen and others in particular, he
#. was projecting his own “shadow side,” his long-held fears and grievances,
#. into his situation there. Every beginning ACIM student learns that the
#. subjective experience of one’s outer circumstances faithfully reflects an
#. inner state of mind. Stated more bluntly, the more guilt one carries, even
#. though unconsciously, the more one feels punished by outer conditions. Bill
#. certainly contributed to the problems in his environment as he projected
#. his own judgments, fears, unconscious conditioning, and unexamined
#. assumptions about how life should be into the situation, as do we all. He
#. knew about projection theoretically—the process of seeing in others what we
#. fear to own in ourselves—but clearly knew little about dealing with that
#. process personally. Despite his talents, training, and potential, he was as
#. sound asleep as the rest of us. Early in ACIM’s text, one finds, “Yet the
#. Bible says that a deep sleep fell upon Adam, and nowhere is there reference
#. to his waking up. The world has not yet experienced any comprehensive
#. reawakening or rebirth. Such a rebirth is impossible as long as you
#. continue to project or mis-create.”[43] After the Course arrived and Bill
#. became more familiar with its uncompromising tenets on how we cause our own
#. distress, he ultimately became willing to begin changing his mind, and that
#. willingness led to success—to his actual waking up.

#. Context: Obviously, from Bill’s recounting of what the university was like
#. in general and his relationships with Helen and others in particular, he
#. was projecting his own “shadow side,” his long-held fears and grievances,
#. into his situation there. Every beginning ACIM student learns that the
#. subjective experience of one’s outer circumstances faithfully reflects an
#. inner state of mind. Stated more bluntly, the more guilt one carries, even
#. though unconsciously, the more one feels punished by outer conditions. Bill
#. certainly contributed to the problems in his environment as he projected
#. his own judgments, fears, unconscious conditioning, and unexamined
#. assumptions about how life should be into the situation, as do we all. He
#. knew about projection theoretically—the process of seeing in others what we
#. fear to own in ourselves—but clearly knew little about dealing with that
#. process personally. Despite his talents, training, and potential, he was as
#. sound asleep as the rest of us. Early in ACIM’s text, one finds, “Yet the
#. Bible says that a deep sleep fell upon Adam, and nowhere is there reference
#. to his waking up. The world has not yet experienced any comprehensive
#. reawakening or rebirth. Such a rebirth is impossible as long as you
#. continue to project or mis-create.”[43] After the Course arrived and Bill
#. became more familiar with its uncompromising tenets on how we cause our own
#. distress, he ultimately became willing to begin changing his mind, and that
#. willingness led to success—to his actual waking up.
