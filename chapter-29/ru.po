#. Context: As the daily ACIM transcription process stretched into months,
#. then years, Bill and Helen had mused about whether it would ever end, and
#. if so, how they might know that. At first, they thought it would be only a
#. few pages long, but as it continued to unfold, it became clear it was a
#. much longer work. Now, four decades later, we can say offhandedly, “Oh yes,
#. the Course consists of a text, a workbook, and teacher’s manual,” but they
#. had no way of knowing that early on. When they inquired, the inner Voice
#. told them they would recognize the end of dictation (of the text) when they
#. heard the word Amen. I am consistently moved to tears, imagining that
#. October morning in 1968, when Helen slowly read the words, “And now we say
#. Amen,” the first sentence in the final paragraph of the text.

#. Context: And as for Bill, now we say Amen. Those who knew and loved him

#. made that commitment to practice complete forgiveness, he never really
#. wavered. Everyone noticed the steady dissolution of his ego, that process
#. markedly accelerating after he moved to La Jolla. His prayers for help,
#. indeed, were granted, and one day Bill simply woke up, walked out of
#. “prison,” and declared his own independence on July 4, 1988. No one who

#. little jig as he walked in the door. Then he kissed me and said, “You won’t
#. believe what happened, you won’t believe what happened!” I said, “What?”
#. still a little miffed. He said, “We had terrible, terrible traffic and
#. Jerry didn’t get angry once!” I looked at Jerry and he sort of shrugged,
#. smiling his little embarrassed smile because that remark meant that he
