"On the last weekend Bill and Jo spent together, he had declared his "
"intention to take more risks, expand his reach, and be ever more true to "

"manipulating and negotiating skills at a very early age. As with all of us, "
"Bill’s imprisonment began in childhood; with each grievance he collected, "

"an unshared, lonely prison. But with each choice to change his mind, a bar "
"vanished, and he felt more powerful, integrated, secure, confident, and able"
" to access his inborn wisdom. He was in charge of the prison doors and could"

"In the dream, his friend, Calvin Hatcher, the only other administrator at "
"Columbia who knew at the time what he and Helen were up to, had taken Bill "
"and me to an opera in New York City. For whatever reason, our tickets were "
"split and Bill was sitting two or three rows in front of me; Calvin and Judy"
" were in my row and farther down the line was Frances [Vaughan]. About the "
"time people would be reading their program notes, some ladies came through; "
"if you were at a ballgame you would say they were hotdog and beer hawkers. "
"But these were very straight, ethereal-looking, ballerina-type ladies and "
"they were handing out chocolate sundaes, for which Bill had a particular "
"fondness. Not only were there chocolate sundaes, but those coffee-crunch "
"things you could put on top, which he also loved. I thought this was very "
"strange, but they were very good and I noticed that he was eating his. About"
" the time you would expect the overture to begin, Bill stood up from his "
"chair, turned around to face us, and said, “I have come full circle in my "
"life. All the things that I didn’t understand, all the things I was afraid "
"to say, I now want to share with you.” He proceeded to give the most "
"exquisite, simple, eloquent speech that moved absolutely everybody. Knowing "
"how he hated to speak in public and the anxiety it caused him, the "
"relaxation with which he delivered this truth of his life was an incredible "
"thing to behold. When he was finished, Frances, Judy, Calvin, and I looked "
"at each other and said we thought we knew Bill, but this was a totally new "
"dimension of this person that we all loved so much. Nobody applauded but "
"when he finished, everybody stood up with tears running down their cheeks. "
"The house was filled and people started to gather in small clumps or groups "
"and began to tell each other the truth of their lives with the same utter "
"defenselessness, vulnerability, and trust that he had exhibited when he "
"stood and talked with us. I saw Bill beaming down on absolutely everyone at "
"what he had set in motion. That was the end of the dream. The next morning "
"when I awakened, I was in a joyful state. I knew that Bill had come to "
"something in his life that was totally freeing, absolutely new, and the "
"achievement of a lifetime. Naturally, my ego got involved and wondered if it"
" was my own projection, so I waited eagerly for his next visit to share the "
"dream with him, to see for myself whether or not it was true. As we now "
"know, it was a dream but it was also true.[6]"
