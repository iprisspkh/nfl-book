#. Context: The one that immediately comes up is that he was so shy. It took
#. me a while to appreciate that it was an extraordinary degree of humility.
#. He was unduly self-deprecating but I came to appreciate that that was just
#. a very genuine and deep form of humility. When I first saw the Course, I
#. opened it up and saw those words “God” and “Holy Spirit” and said, “No
#. thanks.” One time, Bill and Jerry were making a presentation on ACIM at the
#. American Psychiatric Conference in San Francisco. I remember going to the
#. gathering afterwards and meeting Bill there and literally having the
#. thought, “Well, if this guy’s into it, I’m interested.” . . . He served the
#. purpose of opening doors for me in the sense that I came from a very hard-
#. core scientific, materialist, reductionist, anti-spiritual background and
#. he was someone who I could not pretend to be brighter than, and yet who
#. himself had come around to appreciate this material, so I appreciated it.
