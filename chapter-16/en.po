"These observations include several critically important ideas. First, we all"
" know individuals who take up a great deal of psychic space, who seem to "
"take all the air out of a room, who dominate with “I, me, and mine—it’s all "
"about me.” No one warms to that person and yet we all believe that we "
"require some degree of self-promotion to be happy, secure, and prosperous. "
"However, if you ask someone to elaborate on how that happens, you will not "
"get a valid answer. We have fallen into the trap of believing that taking up"
" space is good and necessary, competing for it through attempts to be "
"special. The philosopher Douglas Harding often speaks of “disappearing in "
"favor of the other person,” another way of stating Bill’s capacity for open "
"acceptance. It seems a paradox that the more wholeheartedly present we are "
"for others, the more we “disappear,” the more everyone gains. This "
"contradicts our earliest programming of how to “stake out our territory.” If"
" we gathered up all the “I, me, and mine” thought patterns and rolled them "
"up to almost nothing—figuratively speaking—our happiness would increase. "
"Focusing on the other, rather than self, is a major component of "
"forgiveness. One caution: taking up no space does not mean withholding, "
"hiding, or defending. Keeping things bottled up for fear of being "
"unacceptable is hardly a no-space situation. Feeling inferior with the need "
"to hide can result in one’s being an irritable, high-maintenance person, "
"indeed."
