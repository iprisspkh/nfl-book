#. Context: While planning for one of his visits, I asked Bill if he would
#. allow me to host a reception so that some in the local ACIM community could
#. meet him. He said he would be happy for that to happen; he willingly
#. accepted even though he could have said no. On the appointed date, the
#. house and yard filled with people eager to meet him. He responded to their
#. enthusiasm graciously as if being a social butterfly was his favorite
#. thing, once again adapting to the situation. Though he didn’t seek it, he
#. understood their desire to meet and visit with him. However, as I grew to
#. know his secret heart better, I learned that being the focus of attention
#. was contrary to his basic nature, and I never put him through that again.
#. In agreeing to the party, Bill was simply being generous, not phony or
#. selling out. He was able to rise to any occasion when he chose.

#. Context: Perhaps we should call forgiveness “Process X” to distinguish it

#. roof of a building found in many parts of the world. The thatch, being
#. tightly woven, is strong and impenetrable. All those little sticks and
#. twigs, for our purposes, represent our incessant train of
#. thoughts—judgments, future plans, grievances, regrets, defenses, learned
#. behavior designed for our physical and psychological survival, worries,
#. self-images, roles we play, and pictures about how life is supposed to be.
#. This omnipresent complex of thoughts, to which we are seriously addicted,
#. has become like a solid wall that seems to surround us, separating us from
#. the direct experience of life in the moment. We “think” about life rather
#. than experience it directly. A Course In Miracles, brilliantly conceived
#. and crafted, is so lengthy because it presents a process for relinquishing
#. these “twigs” rather than a body of material to be learned. We tightly
#. clutch these interwoven thoughts, believing we need them to survive and
#. flourish, and are rarely open-minded on the subject. “Strong and
#. impenetrable” are wonderful attributes if you want to keep the rain out or

#. Presuming everything was already clear to Bill, I asked him what it meant.
#. He said he had no idea. I was floored and thought to myself, “What do you
#. mean, you don’t know what this means?” I now realize that although he knew
#. a tremendous amount about the Course, he still retained unhealed grievances
#. that would necessarily cause blank areas or blind spots in his
#. comprehension. When the mind is not clouded with grievances, everything
