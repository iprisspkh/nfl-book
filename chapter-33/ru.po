#. Context: It is a simple fact that this book is possible only because of
#. extensive and heartfelt input from many of Bill’s closest friends, and to
#. them I am grateful beyond measure. Although I already possessed many
#. documents and much information about Bill, the Foundation for Inner Peace
#. kindly made their archives available to fill in the gaps. Without Judy and
#. Whit Whitson, who along with Bob Skutch and Kenneth Wapnick are the centers
#. of the original ACIM family, it would be a decidedly less complete work.
#. They have generously shared their time, their memories of Bill, and their
#. enthusiasm for the project. Nor would it have come together without the
#. excellent suggestions and expertise of my dear, lifelong friend and
#. professional editor, Sarah Whalen-Kraft. She has skillfully assisted in
#. turning my memories poured out on paper and my transcribed conversations
#. with more than thirty people into a more graceful document. I extend
#. sincere thanks also to Julie Ruffo, who provided specialized editorial
#. services and assisted with publishing decisions. My treasured friend, Alice
#. MacMahon, served as reader, unofficial editor, and cheerleader for the
#. project. So too, my sons Greg and Nelson were wholeheartedly in favor of my
#. writing Bill’s story and encouraged me to persevere when the mountain of
#. details and information seemed daunting. My fun-loving friend, Judie
#. Chiappone, who definitely never forgets to laugh, took the back cover
#. picture. Last but certainly not least, Cathy Sanders and Kathryn Van Aernum
#. brought their extensive graphic design experience and good will to the
#. layout design and cover respectively.
