#. Context: Well, I can tell you, everything about him was this deep
#. connection with God combined with his advice not to take it all too
#. seriously—one of the primary themes of Bill’s life and the great gift he
#. gave the world. Every conversation I had with him had an effect on me
#. because I was taking the Course very seriously and you just couldn’t do
#. that with Bill. I wish everyone could have felt his very lighthearted
#. approach to the Course. As a matter of fact, I think one of the reasons he
#. kept telling these stories, pointing out the absurdity of everything that
#. had gone on when the Course came, whether done consciously or not, was for
#. the effect it had of lightening me up on the whole subject. Additionally,
#. he just thought it infinitely amusing that the CIA had financed so much of
#. their work, and he always joked about the typewriter—the CIA-funded
#. typewriter that typed ACIM.[49]
