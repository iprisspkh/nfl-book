#. Context: Life was very hard for Bill on returning home. He felt depressed
#. and lonely after the breakup of a long-term personal relationship with
#. Charles Parrish and shut out of the “special relationship” that he
#. perceived Helen and Ken were pursuing without him. Bill was also
#. increasingly dissatisfied with the absence of spiritual focus in his job.
#. He even considered leaving the medical center entirely, wanting only to
#. hurry up, complete the last clerical details of the Course, and call the
#. whole thing finished. Both Helen and Bill were clear that marketing and
#. distribution were not theirs to do once the final editing was complete in
#. 1975, and not knowing how else to proceed, Bill made twelve copies of the
#. entire work, put them in thesis binders, and locked them in the bottom
#. drawer of his file cabinet.

#. Context: Obviously, this monumental work was not destined to remain in the
#. bottom drawer. In the spring of 1975, through a serendipitous series of
#. events, Bill and Helen placed ACIM into the capable hands of Judith Skutch
#. (Whitson), who became the undisputed matriarch of A Course In Miracles and
#. ultimately provided for its publication and widespread distribution. Bill
#. had become intrigued with a new acquaintance, Douglas Dean—a scientist
#. interested in paranormal healing—and had made plans to have lunch with him.
#. Dean rescheduled their meeting so he could bring his friend, Judith Skutch,
#. for he felt strongly that she should accompany him. Judy was known as a
#. “cosmic catalyst and den mother to parapsychology,” a leader in the field
#. of consciousness exploration and the paranormal. On May 29, 1975, Judy,
#. Douglas, Helen, Bill, and Ken had lunch in the faculty dining room at
#. Columbia. During lunch, as their conversation evolved, Judy found herself
#. unexpectedly saying to Helen, “You’re hearing a voice, aren’t you?”
#. Everyone was stunned. Therefore, after lunch in the privacy of Bill’s
#. office, the three collaborators showed Judy and Douglas the Course, still a
#. secret known only to a handful of people.

#. Context: Almost immediately, Judy became an integral part of the ACIM

#. Bill. She withdrew more and more. She and Bill argued less because he
#. wasn’t around as much. He spent more and more time with Judy and I spent
#. more time with Helen and Louis. We would meet at Judy’s apartment, then
#. Helen and I would go home and Bill would stay. From his point of view, Judy
#. was a breath of fresh air; he was very comfortable with her, enjoying a
#. relationship that didn’t include Helen. Helen had her own relationship with
#. Judy, who was now sometimes the recipient of her anger, but still they were
#. close. When both Bill and Judy moved to the West Coast in 1978, that was
#. the end as far as Helen was concerned. She was very bitter about that, but
#. I think Bill felt a sense of freedom. That’s when everything changed for
#. him, like he was let out of prison. But again, to Helen’s credit, she was
#. always well aware of what she was doing and that made dealing with her

#. furious at Bill, but in fact she knew that I knew, and I knew that she

#. most, that is the case. ACIM teaches, however, this need not be. Our
