"After our first visit in Tiburon, a pattern emerged: Bill and I met every "

"stay with my family—my husband and two young boys—and in turn, I would visit"
" Tiburon and stay with him or, later, with Jerry, sometimes to participate "
"in planned events and sometimes for no reason. This schedule continued for "

"patio, listen to his tales, or conversely, be included in his daily routine "
"as he settled into California. He had dropped suddenly and unexpectedly into"
" the middle of my life, and it took a bit of getting used to."
