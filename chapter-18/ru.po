#. Context: Even as Bill had struggled during the ACIM scribing era, feeling
#. it was so difficult, the purifying effect was under way. The entire process
#. of receiving and typing the material—the discussions and arguments about
#. its meaning and then the editing—forced Bill and Helen to focus on it
#. continually. Even when not doing the lessons or studying, they were under
#. its influence, and by the time I met Bill, much “unlearning” had occurred,
#. though it wasn’t yet complete. He was becoming very clear and being with
#. him always felt light and free, even when he was depressed. These “down”
#. periods, when he entertained the preposterous notion that he didn’t have
#. much to offer, didn’t keep others from enjoying his marvelous presence. He
#. was a “work in progress,” still harboring some grievances, but his loving
#. nature was always apparent, his light still shining through, and his help
#. unfailingly available.
