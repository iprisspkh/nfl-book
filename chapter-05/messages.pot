"As another sign that shifts in consciousness were occurring, almost "

"waking visions and strange dreams; she acutely feared losing her vision and,"
" indeed, her mind. Those dreams and waking visions, in retrospect, pointed "
"to the coming of ACIM, but at the time seemed obscure and unintelligible. "
"For instance, one vision involved Helen’s seeing herself in a small boat "
"being carried along a lovely canal. She mused about the possibility of "
"buried treasure in the area and noticed a long pole with a hook in the "
"bottom of the boat. She dropped the hook into the water and pulled up an "
"ancient treasure chest; on opening it, she was disappointed to find nothing "
"but a large black book, specifically a black thesis binder, exactly like "
"those that would be used years later to store the typed notes of A Course In"
" Miracles for safekeeping. Down the spine was written one word in gold, "
"Aesculapius. Neither Bill nor Helen knew what it meant, although it had a "
"familiar ring to it. A few nights later, she dreamed of that black book "
"again, now with pearls draped around it. Aesculapius was the Greek god of "
"healing and historians believe the legends surrounding his medical work were"

"second century, Galen, did much research at the Aesculapion in Pergamon, "
"Turkey (then part of the Roman Empire), and embodied the Aesculapion "

"Again, Jesus [the Christ] does not speak in words. To say it differently and"
" succinctly here, his is the content, our minds (and brains) supply the "
"form. Therefore, Helen’s decision-making mind identified itself with the "
"non-ego presence that is in everyone. This non-judgmental thought system of "
"love was represented for her by Jesus, as it is for so many of us. Her mind "
"took that non-specific love and translated it into words, in much the same "
"way as our brains translate the upside-down image cast on the retina into "
"right-side-up perceptions. And so, as I have said many times, the form of "
"the Course is from Helen. . . . The content of A Course in Miracles, "
"however, is clearly not Helen’s, at least not the Helen the world knew or "
"the person she consciously identified with. This explains why she felt at "
"liberty to change the form, though never the content. Helen knew what the "
"published Course ought to be. One could make recommendations, and Bill and I"
