#. Context: Into eternity, where all is one, there crept a tiny, mad idea, at
#. which the Son of God remembered not to laugh. In his forgetting did the
#. thought become a serious idea, and possible of both accomplishment and real
#. effects. Together, we can laugh them both away, and understand that time
#. cannot intrude upon eternity. It is a joke to think that time can come to
#. circumvent eternity, which means there is no time.[1]

#. Context: If ever there was one who learned to joke about the absurdity of
#. the human condition, it was Bill Thetford. He was graced with a superb
#. sense of humor, delighting in the antics, large and small, of both himself
#. and his fellow human beings. A prayer in the liturgy of the Episcopal
#. Church begins, “Almighty God, unto whom all hearts are open, all desires
#. known, and from whom no secrets are hid, . . .” Bill was a mortal version
#. of that omniscience; for him his fellow man was deeply transparent, an open
#. book—and often a comic book. His lighthearted touch was his hallmark as he
#. saw the comedy in the ego’s serious postures. He laughed not at people,
#. however, but at our treasured notions, beliefs, and practiced self-
#. deceptions.

#. Context: While finishing the interviews for this book, Hugh Prather, best-
#. selling author and one of Bill’s confidants, and I reminisced by phone
#. about the gift he was to us, especially about how witty and funny he could
#. be. One of Bill’s favorite early Course stories, told with kindhearted
#. laughter, was about a gentleman who discovered his address in Manhattan and
#. came knocking on his door. When Bill answered, the man earnestly announced
#. that he was a new ACIM student and that the Holy Spirit told him to find
#. Bill and ask him for $10,000. Without missing a beat, Bill responded that
#. the Holy Spirit had already alerted him to this request and indicated he
#. was not to give it to him. I can still see Bill’s delighted smile as he
#. recounted such entertaining tales about humankind in general and Course-
#. related drama in particular. He often said he thought he should write a
#. book entitled A Course In Miracles Follies about the craziness that
#. occurred while bringing this material into the world, as well as some of
#. the strange ideas and misperceptions that have been perpetuated in its
#. name. To his credit, he found these occurrences amusing rather than
#. alarming, and we would all benefit from emulating his lighthearted
#. approach.

#. guilty that they remain after the brother or sister has gone. Or they worry

#. the physical body and the role forgiveness plays in restoring both mind and
#. body to health. Hundreds of pages address this topic in no uncertain terms.

#. Context: During high school Bill had reconnected with a kindergarten

#. illness. Simply good friends in high school (she was “going steady” with
#. someone else then), their relationship evolved into something more after
#. graduation. She was his only acknowledged girl friend, according to all
#. available information. Their parents knew each other and the two young
#. people were definitely considered an “item.” At Thanksgiving in 1943 he
#. gave her his fraternity pin, in those days considered almost the same as an

#. Context: They went together, as a long-distance romance (he was at DePauw
