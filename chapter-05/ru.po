#. Context: If ever there was one who learned to joke about the absurdity of
#. the human condition, it was Bill Thetford. He was graced with a superb
#. sense of humor, delighting in the antics, large and small, of both himself
#. and his fellow human beings. A prayer in the liturgy of the Episcopal
#. Church begins, “Almighty God, unto whom all hearts are open, all desires
#. known, and from whom no secrets are hid, . . .” Bill was a mortal version
#. of that omniscience; for him his fellow man was deeply transparent, an open
#. book—and often a comic book. His lighthearted touch was his hallmark as he
#. saw the comedy in the ego’s serious postures. He laughed not at people,
#. however, but at our treasured notions, beliefs, and practiced self-

#. came knocking on his door. When Bill answered, the man earnestly announced
#. that he was a new ACIM student and that the Holy Spirit told him to find
#. Bill and ask him for $10,000. Without missing a beat, Bill responded that
#. the Holy Spirit had already alerted him to this request and indicated he
#. was not to give it to him. I can still see Bill’s delighted smile as he
#. recounted such entertaining tales about humankind in general and Course-
#. related drama in particular. He often said he thought he should write a
#. book entitled A Course In Miracles Follies about the craziness that
#. occurred while bringing this material into the world, as well as some of
#. the strange ideas and misperceptions that have been perpetuated in its
#. name. To his credit, he found these occurrences amusing rather than
