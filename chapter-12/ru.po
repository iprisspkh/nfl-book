#. Context: As with all chapters, Bill’s time in New York was coming to a
#. close. ACIM was finished and Helen, fourteen years his senior, had finally
#. retired. He had managed to keep her employed past the usual retirement age
#. of sixty-five to finish the last Course details. Before they had
#. contemplated its publication, Bill had applied for and been granted a six-
#. month sabbatical to begin in July 1976. Through no intentional planning,
#. the first edition of ACIM made its debut the month before, in June 1976.
#. With the next stage of the Course’s history unfolding, coupled with the
#. fact that it was a difficult time at the university in general, it was a
#. great time to leave. Bill felt he simply could not stay at Columbia now
#. that their “guilty secret,” as they called it, was out in the open, a
#. potentially awkward situation for everyone else concerned, as well. (He did
#. not specifically attempt to conceal or reveal his association with ACIM.
#. Some colleagues found out about it through conversation or the few articles
#. ultimately written about the work. Others may never have found out.) He had
#. been through a ten-year, life-altering, spiritual overhaul, and to resume
#. his work with traditional psychology as though nothing had happened, no
#. matter how proficient he was, would have been an impossible backward step.

#. Context: As his sabbatical was ending in early 1977, Bill took a leave of
#. absence, then applied for another, but the second one was denied. He now
#. had to make a final decision to stay or leave. He chose to leave. Because
#. he had started at Columbia in February 1958, he was eligible for early
#. retirement beginning in 1978. Thus, after beginning his sabbatical in mid
#. 1976, he never returned to his academic or administrative duties. During
#. that period of being employed but not actively working, he made several
#. trips to California, at Judy’s invitation, to meet with groups about the
#. Course. (Helen also participated in a few of them, although under protest
#. because she strongly disliked traveling.) These trips planted the seed in
#. Bill and introduced the possibility of leaving not only Columbia, but New
#. York itself. The Skutches were entertaining the idea of moving to Tiburon
#. because Judy planned to work on her Ph.D. in San Francisco and,
#. additionally, she knew many people in the Bay area. Also, Jerry Jampolsky,
#. a close friend of Judy’s, was a long-time resident of Tiburon. During those
#. visits, Bill realized that both Jerry and Judy needed help with their
#. personal lives and that living close to them would be ideal for offering

#. Context: As his sabbatical was ending in early 1977, Bill took a leave of
#. absence, then applied for another, but the second one was denied. He now
#. had to make a final decision to stay or leave. He chose to leave. Because
#. he had started at Columbia in February 1958, he was eligible for early
#. retirement beginning in 1978. Thus, after beginning his sabbatical in mid
#. 1976, he never returned to his academic or administrative duties. During
#. that period of being employed but not actively working, he made several
#. trips to California, at Judy’s invitation, to meet with groups about the
#. Course. (Helen also participated in a few of them, although under protest
#. because she strongly disliked traveling.) These trips planted the seed in
#. Bill and introduced the possibility of leaving not only Columbia, but New
#. York itself. The Skutches were entertaining the idea of moving to Tiburon
#. because Judy planned to work on her Ph.D. in San Francisco and,
#. additionally, she knew many people in the Bay area. Also, Jerry Jampolsky,
#. a close friend of Judy’s, was a long-time resident of Tiburon. During those
#. visits, Bill realized that both Jerry and Judy needed help with their
#. personal lives and that living close to them would be ideal for offering
#. his assistance. This provided a pivotal rationale for moving.
