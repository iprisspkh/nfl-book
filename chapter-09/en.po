#. Context: As another sign that shifts in consciousness were occurring,
#. almost immediately after Bill’s crisis in the spring of 1965, Helen began
#. having waking visions and strange dreams; she acutely feared losing her
#. vision and, indeed, her mind. Those dreams and waking visions, in
#. retrospect, pointed to the coming of ACIM, but at the time seemed obscure
#. and unintelligible. For instance, one vision involved Helen’s seeing
#. herself in a small boat being carried along a lovely canal. She mused about
#. the possibility of buried treasure in the area and noticed a long pole with
#. a hook in the bottom of the boat. She dropped the hook into the water and
#. pulled up an ancient treasure chest; on opening it, she was disappointed to
#. find nothing but a large black book, specifically a black thesis binder,
#. exactly like those that would be used years later to store the typed notes
#. of A Course In Miracles for safekeeping. Down the spine was written one
#. word in gold, Aesculapius. Neither Bill nor Helen knew what it meant,
#. although it had a familiar ring to it. A few nights later, she dreamed of
#. that black book again, now with pearls draped around it. Aesculapius was
#. the Greek god of healing and historians believe the legends surrounding his
#. medical work were based on the life of an historical person. A well-known
#. physician of the second century, Galen, did much research at the
#. Aesculapion in Pergamon, Turkey (then part of the Roman Empire), and
#. embodied the Aesculapion traditions for treating not just the physically
#. but the mentally ill, as well. Helen’s dream surely was an accurate
#. premonition of the healing treasure to come.

#. Context: The series ended on a note of final achievement and even glory. I
#. was standing in a room that seemed to be on the top floor of a church
#. building. Bill, seated at a large, old-fashioned church organ, was playing
#. Handel’s Hallelujah Chorus with his face lit with joy. We had finally
#. reached our goal. I was standing in front of a simple brown wooden altar,
#. on which two words were written one underneath the other. I cannot imagine
#. a less appropriate pair. The top word was “Elohim,” which I did not
#. recognize at the time, and only later discovered is one of the Hebrew names
#. for God. The other word, “Evoe,” I did identify as the cry of the Greek
#. Bacchantes [a priestess or female votary of Bacchus; a female participant
#. in a drunken or orgiastic revel] in celebrating the rites of Bacchus [the
#. god of grape-growing and of wine]. As I watched, a streak of lightning from
#. the back of the church struck the altar and obliterated the second word
#. entirely. Only “Elohim” remained, written in bright gold letters. The
#. Hallelujah Chorus rose to a crescendo, and a figure outlined in brilliant
#. light which I recognized immediately as Jesus stepped from behind the altar
#. and came toward me. I started to kneel in front of him, but he came around
#. to my side and knelt at the altar with me. Bill rose and knelt at his other
#. side. And then a Voice, with which I was to become increasingly familiar,
#. said in silent but perfectly clear words, “That altar is within you.” The

#. She said all the writing was voluntary, never “automatic writing,” which
#. she could start and stop at will, and she was pleased with its coherence
#. even though the material was antithetical to everything she believed. That,
#. she said, confused her no end. She ended her commentary by saying that the

#. Context: Because increased upset is such a common experience for new

#. students this is likely to happen and that it’s reasonable to ask why they
#. should embark on a practice that might stir up more upset. The answer, of

#. is ultimately required of everyone, not to inflict punishment but because
#. this is how to release them. Bill found—as everyone eventually finds—that
#. tolerance for pain is only so high. The introduction to the text speaks of
#. removing the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence. When we ask for
#. help, we become aware of those blocks or fears so that we can address them
#. directly and make happier, more sane and peaceful choices.

#. Context: Since Bill and Helen were devoting extensive time to the Course
#. project, but seemed to be getting nowhere with healing their relationship,
#. Bill decided to test its premises with other, less volatile relationships
#. that needed attention. If it could produce changes with a difficult
#. colleague, he thought, it ought to work anywhere. Judy Skutch Whitson
#. recalls Bill’s telling her more than a few times, with unusual (for him)
#. seriousness, about one of his first dedicated attempts to practice ACIM as
#. the lessons were being dictated.

#. Context: Art was co-director of the department of psychology with Bill. [In
#. fact, he had been instrumental in Bill’s coming to Columbia in the first
#. place.] They were friends, had had a long walk together professionally, and
#. I think accepted and liked each other. Then Bill hired Helen and all hell
#. broke loose. Art didn’t like Helen, really didn’t like her, and had great
#. antipathy toward her. Bill told me that Art thought she certainly did
#. excellent research work but that she was too much trouble, a high-
#. maintenance lady and distracting at meetings. He found her sharp; in other
#. words, they didn’t get along. At times, he asked Bill to fire Helen and
#. Bill dug in, unequivocally refusing to do that.
