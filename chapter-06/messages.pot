"Although neither Bill nor Helen had been consciously interested in religious"
" or spiritual matters before ACIM dictation began, Bill quickly recognized "
"the universal nature of the material and began a serious inquiry into the "
"world’s major religious traditions and teachings. In his search for "
"corroboration, he discovered the nondualistic teaching of Advaita Vedanta "
"from India and immediately saw its parallels to the Course. Thus he dubbed "
"ACIM the “Christian Vedanta” because of its use of Christian language to "
"present these truths. He became more impressed with the Course as his study "
"deepened, finding it integrated and synthesized the best of the teachings he"
" investigated—and it was practical. He read extensively in his newly "
"discovered field of interest and became extremely well versed in this "
"formerly uninteresting subject. Many of Bill’s friends and colleagues said "
"he had an astounding capacity to absorb vast quantities of written material "
"quickly, a valuable trait given that he had five thousand years of mystical "
"traditions to explore. Years later, he noted with some disappointment that "
"the PAS, on which he had lavished so much time and attention, did not "
"explain or even address the spiritual dimension of our life experience. How "
"unexpectedly our lives can change and even reverse course."

"One of the ways you could see their differences was that Helen was overtly "

" to forgive Bill, would not forgive Bill, and she wasn’t saying this was a "
"spiritual position. Bill, on the other hand, was not aware. I can give you "
"one example that typified the whole issue. They had three offices, an outer "

"this. We were sitting in Helen’s office; there was Helen and her desk, I sat"
" against the wall adjacent to her desk, and Bill would be standing in the "

"asking me to support him against Helen, saying something like, “Wouldn’t you"

" as much at fault, but she was right in your face, she knew what she was "
