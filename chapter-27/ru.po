#. Context: In October 1986, Bill moved permanently to La Jolla. He had
#. released much in Tiburon and done a marvelous job, as Frances Vaughan
#. stated earlier, of learning to “take up no space,” inserting virtually no
#. “personality noise.” However, not wanting to be egocentric can sometimes be
#. a cover for emotional repression; he retained some old inhibitions and
#. defense patterns when it came to self-expression. La Jolla was about
#. sorting this out so he could more easily express his loving, gracious
#. energy without reservation. He knew, as did those close to him, that the
#. healing uniquely possible through his friends in southern California would
#. be the major focus of the rest of his life. Forgiveness was still “job
#. one.”
