"In his relationship with Pat, Bill would continue that housecleaning, moving"
" yet another step toward his liberation. Despite all they had in common and "
"their great admiration for one another, Pat indicated that “nevertheless, "
"living together did not always go smoothly for us” and that their time "
"together was “the best of times and the worst of times, to quote "
"Dickens.”[3] This is exactly what one might expect from a relationship so "
"important to their mutual growth. I’ve always thought we learn our lessons "
"with our closest friends, who agree at some level to be the mirror to our "
"own fears, though at the time it can feel decidedly unfriendly. The people "
"we live with provide the setup for deep and essential work, if we choose. "
"Bill followed his own unique path to waking up as he built and maintained "
"various relationships throughout his life that delivered exactly what he was"
" willing to deal with at any given moment. The introduction to the Course "
"text says, “Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. "
"It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time.”[4] "
"We do have to unlearn our fear and guilt. We can drag our feet or dedicate "
"ourselves in a cooperative manner to discovering those beliefs masking as "
"truths. Clearly, Bill and Pat’s relationship had the same purpose: mutual "
"healing, regardless of whatever reasons or needs seemed to draw them "
"together. Bob Howe recalled, “I remember sitting down there in his "
"condominium when Pat was living with him and they were arguing about which "
"way the toilet paper should be on the holder. And the paper towels. Each one"
" had their own inner secrecy and you kinda knew they had their own thoughts,"
