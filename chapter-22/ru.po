#. Context: The role of a teacher, properly conceived, is one of leading
#. himself and others out of the desert [i.e., ignorance or unawareness]. The
#. value of this role can hardly be underestimated, if only because it was one
#. to which I very gladly dedicated my life. I have repeatedly asked my pupils
#. to follow me. This means that to be effective teachers they must interpret
#. teaching as I do. I have made every effort to teach you entirely without
#. fear. If you do not listen, you will be unable to avoid the very obvious
#. error of perceiving teaching as a threat.

#. Context: Bill was a walking miracle, innocently loving, exerting an
#. enormously powerful healing influence while not realizing what he was
#. providing. His gift was innocence, not specialness, and that came from
#. being willing to change his mind. What more need be said about the
#. unutterable power of perceiving one another, and ourselves, as innocent at
#. our very core, despite what our senses observe? The choice is universally
#. available to everyone. Thus, despite his ambivalence about teaching, for
#. many Bill was the greatest teacher they had ever known.

#. physical death is not the end. In this life—a chapter in the ongoing
#. continuity—defenses develop early and take place within the context of
#. “family,” however that is construed. Bill seems to have had a loving

#. was ill; apparently, he had no particular issues with her. His father, on
#. the other hand, was his challenge. Bill rarely mentioned him, perhaps even
#. feared him. He was a working man and often absent, and it seems Bill
#. experienced him as not being present for him physically or emotionally.
#. Bill confided that he had felt “the wrong child died,” a haunting, guilt-
#. ridden statement about his beloved sister’s sudden passing when he was
#. seven. Deeply traumatized by her death, he said that, at his sister’s
#. funeral, his father, who adored the little girl, seemed to convey that Bill
#. should have been the one to die. No one knows if that was the father’s
#. intention, but he did shut off from his son, and six months later Bill
#. became seriously ill. He also remembered his father berating him later on
#. for being a financial burden because of that illness and ultimately
#. becoming ill himself through worry and grief. Jo, his college girlfriend,
#. knew both Bill’s parents and commented, “His father was sort of a strict,
#. rigid gentleman. I don’t think Bill ever really related to him well. His
#. mother [who worked two jobs to help supplement their income], I would say,

#. Context: ACIM is very clear that physical birth is not our beginning and
#. physical death is not the end. In this life—a chapter in the ongoing
#. continuity—defenses develop early and take place within the context of
#. “family,” however that is construed. Bill seems to have had a loving
#. relationship with his mother. She read to him and took care of him while he
#. was ill; apparently, he had no particular issues with her. His father, on
#. the other hand, was his challenge. Bill rarely mentioned him, perhaps even
#. feared him. He was a working man and often absent, and it seems Bill
#. experienced him as not being present for him physically or emotionally.
#. Bill confided that he had felt “the wrong child died,” a haunting, guilt-
#. ridden statement about his beloved sister’s sudden passing when he was
#. seven. Deeply traumatized by her death, he said that, at his sister’s
#. funeral, his father, who adored the little girl, seemed to convey that Bill
#. should have been the one to die. No one knows if that was the father’s
#. intention, but he did shut off from his son, and six months later Bill

#. Context: No wonder Bill was always in the “prepare to escape” mode, being
