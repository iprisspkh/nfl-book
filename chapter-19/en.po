#. Context: Bill was also private, shy, deliberately compartmentalized, and

#. decades ago. Incidentally, Bill would not have discussed his sexual
#. preference even if he had been heterosexual, considering that déclasse and
#. none of anyone’s business. He used to joke, “Keep your life a muddle and no
#. one will ever know what’s going on.” In his reading in 1980, Leroy Zemke

#. Context: Almost everyone was disarmed by Bill’s transparency, which was
#. profoundly effective. One might ask how this squares with being secretive,
#. but the answer is easy. He felt the need for privacy at the human level and
#. to keep secret his thoughts and actions, but he couldn’t hide his energetic
#. presence. The unalterable truth of him, his loving reality, was always
#. apparent. As part of his inclination to secrecy, he rarely expressed a
#. strong personal opinion or commented on political issues or current events.
#. I never heard anyone attempt a political or other controversial
#. conversation with him. Jack Luckett shared his thoughts about Bill’s sense
#. of patriotism: “He knew he was lucky to be born a white American male but
#. he wasn’t sure about the gay part. We used to go to 4th of July
#. celebrations in La Jolla, and when well done, he found them moving. I think
#. sometimes he found my gung-ho Marine commitment amusing, but he admired it
#. as well.”[3] His wife Layle added, “You knew Billy very well and know he
#. was not passionate about much except opera and Mozart! I’d call him
#. ‘neutral’ regarding patriotism. Certainly he was not a flag-waving,
#. ‘America first’ kind of a guy, but he appreciated being born here. Maybe he
#. was too removed from human ‘life-in-time [and space]’ to concern himself
#. with feeling superior over his choice of birthplaces.”[4] Jack concluded,
#. “Bill was as complex as a Chinese puzzle but had a strong desire just to be
#. normal.”[5]

#. “untruth” about himself. The word Bill’s friends most often used to
#. describe him was presence. Although inadequate, it is the closest
#. available. Something happened around him; one felt lighter, more expansive.
#. Some expressed it as a calming and radiant quality; others said it was like
#. the room became electrified or filled with an exuberant energy. In any
#. case, it was a great influence in people’s lives and left an indelible

#. Context: If presence was a term universally ascribed to Bill, several

#. you raise me.”[10] Or a more modern translation: “You give me full courage
#. to speak; you lift me until I am more than myself.”[11] That was Bill, and
#. it most fully articulates his greatest gift, the most noted aspect of his
#. way of being—his unsurpassed capacity to support and accept almost anyone
#. or anything. I say “almost,” because in his last decade there were still a
#. few loose ends of forgiveness not yet handled and some persons could still
#. push his buttons. Offering acceptance has a noticeable, substantive healing
#. effect both on those who give and receive it. It speaks in ways far more
#. compelling than words that we are not judged, that we are completely
#. acceptable as we are and deeply cared for. Within the light of Bill’s
#. acceptance, frantic or mindless thought could settle down, accompanied by a
#. deep sense of relief. Imagine no need to defend, impress, convince, or
#. dominate. People relaxed in his presence. Bill’s acceptance had the
#. instantaneous, profound effect of orienting people to their own innate
#. value, and the expansion was automatic. The Course speaks of the healing

"A sentence from Dante’s Paradiso succinctly captures so many people’s "
"subjective experience of him: “You are my sire, said I: you give me heart "
"freely to speak my thought: above myself you raise me.”[10] Or a more modern"
" translation: “You give me full courage to speak; you lift me until I am "
"more than myself.”[11] That was Bill, and it most fully articulates his "
"greatest gift, the most noted aspect of his way of being—his unsurpassed "
"capacity to support and accept almost anyone or anything."

#. in the early 1980s. He indicated that he represented a new kind of awakened
#. cosmic teacher, a living example of what’s possible—a guru, but not in the
#. traditional sense of the word. As he tuned into Bill, he picked up his
#. awakened heart-center energy, a deeply integrated sense of holiness, almost

"LeRoy Zemke made some interesting far-out observations about Bill in the "
"early 1980s."

#. Context: LeRoy Zemke made some interesting far-out observations about Bill
#. in the early 1980s. He indicated that he represented a new kind of awakened
#. cosmic teacher, a living example of what’s possible—a guru, but not in the
#. traditional sense of the word. As he tuned into Bill, he picked up his
#. awakened heart-center energy, a deeply integrated sense of holiness, almost
#. a saintly quality. Bill would have had difficulty accepting any of that,
#. certainly balking at the guru idea, but the final outcome of his life gives
#. credence to those earlier observations.
#: paragraph:40,sentence:2
