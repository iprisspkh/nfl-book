#. Context: Bill was also private, shy, deliberately compartmentalized, and
#. secretive, often keeping various relationships separate from other friends
#. and colleagues. His ability to compartmentalize was ideal for someone who
#. had worked for the CIA and held diverse positions at Columbia, especially
#. for a gay man, given that our society was much less tolerant several
#. decades ago. Incidentally, Bill would not have discussed his sexual
#. preference even if he had been heterosexual, considering that déclasse and
#. none of anyone’s business. He used to joke, “Keep your life a muddle and no
#. one will ever know what’s going on.” In his reading in 1980, Leroy Zemke

#. Context: What does it mean that the Course was “working” on him? Bill knew
#. very well that one doesn’t “take the Course,” as one might take an algebra
#. or chemistry class. The point is not to learn how to get one’s way or
#. acquire facts or strategies more effectively, but to unlearn our early
#. programming. Some persons have labeled ACIM a mind-training course—indeed,
#. it is and thank goodness for that! From birth, our minds are trained to
#. believe in separation, self-absorption, and lack, not only through our
#. families but through all our societal encounters—educational, political,
#. religious, and through the media. That training—unhelpful and inaccurate
#. but not necessarily deliberate—to regard ourselves as smaller and less
#. deserving or important than we really are, must change if we hope to
#. experience any peace of mind. The consistent practice of Course principles
#. drives long-standing, limiting beliefs from our original mind training into
#. conscious awareness, so we can decide whether to be bound by them or not.
#. It’s as if we have all been born and raised in a cult, with the ego as the
#. tyrannical leader, requiring absolute allegiance. Since we know of no other
#. way of being, we presume this is the only way to live. ACIM acts as a
#. “deprogrammer” for our ego-directed brainwashing.

#. Context: LeRoy Zemke made some interesting far-out observations about Bill

#. traditional sense of the word. As he tuned into Bill, he picked up his
#. awakened heart-center energy, a deeply integrated sense of holiness, almost
