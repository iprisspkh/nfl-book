"Early on in California, a coterie of people began to collect around Bill, "
"all part of a grounding network vital to his continued unfolding, while "

" place when Bill left New York. With the morning prayer group, Frances and "
"Roger joined the circle and, along with Jules, became central to his "

"functioned as colleagues but also became his protégés. Additional members of"
" Bill’s support group, from different places and walks of life, showed up "
"throughout his last ten years in precisely the proper order. Those closest "
"to him were all ACIM students and formed a family of sorts; each provided "
"different yet essential elements for his releasing, healing, comforting, and"
" grounding. The foundation was being laid. Bill had made a commitment to "
"practice the Course’s version of forgiveness and help to do so was "
"coalescing. Of course, he had many wonderful friends, colleagues, and "
"partners during his first fifty-five years, but his goals then had been more"
" worldly and divided; he had not yet fully dedicated himself to a spiritual "
"practice. Additionally, many other friends and acquaintances were part of "
"his California life, important in various ways, and who undoubtedly "
