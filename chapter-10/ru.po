#. Context: Although neither Bill nor Helen had been consciously interested in
#. religious or spiritual matters before ACIM dictation began, Bill quickly
#. recognized the universal nature of the material and began a serious inquiry
#. into the world’s major religious traditions and teachings. In his search
#. for corroboration, he discovered the nondualistic teaching of Advaita
#. Vedanta from India and immediately saw its parallels to the Course. Thus he
#. dubbed ACIM the “Christian Vedanta” because of its use of Christian
#. language to present these truths. He became more impressed with the Course
#. as his study deepened, finding it integrated and synthesized the best of
#. the teachings he investigated—and it was practical. He read extensively in
#. his newly discovered field of interest and became extremely well versed in
#. this formerly uninteresting subject. Many of Bill’s friends and colleagues
#. said he had an astounding capacity to absorb vast quantities of written
#. material quickly, a valuable trait given that he had five thousand years of
#. mystical traditions to explore. Years later, he noted with some
#. disappointment that the PAS, on which he had lavished so much time and
#. attention, did not explain or even address the spiritual dimension of our
#. life experience. How unexpectedly our lives can change and even reverse
#. course.

#. Context: As Bill was deepening his research into metaphysics, he became
#. intrigued with a chapter about mysticism and schizophrenia in the book,
#. Higher States of Consciousness, by John White. It was written by Kenneth
#. Wapnick, a young psychologist, and Bill shared it with one of his graduate
#. students, Father Benedict, a Capuchin friar. Benedict, one of the three or
#. four people entrusted with their “guilty secret,” as Bill jokingly called
#. it, subsequently became friendly with Ken and later introduced him to Bill
#. and Helen. Shortly after they met in late 1972, Ken left New York for
#. Israel to live in a monastery, presumably to be his permanent home, having
#. converted from Judaism to Catholicism. Once there, however, he couldn’t get
#. that meeting out of his mind; he dreamt of it, aware of a very strong
#. connection with both of them, especially Helen. His guidance prevailed and
#. in the spring of 1973, as if on cue, he returned to New York (the last
#. place he thought he wanted to be) to meet with them again and to find out
#. more about the manuscript his new friends had mentioned to him earlier. One
#. look and that intriguing book “knocked him off his feet,” to use his
#. words—his fate was sealed. He notified his Israeli friends of his change of
#. plans and re-established himself in New York to be close to “ACIM Central.”
#. Thus, as the dictation was concluding, Kenneth Wapnick officially entered
#. the picture, commencing three more years of editing, rereading, checking
#. for errors, and improving section and chapter titles.

#. all time. She would say things like, “I can’t think of any saint in history
#. who was as beatific as Ken.” So I would have lunch with the Virgin Mary and
#. the world’s greatest saint. Of course, I was the world’s greatest sinner; I
#. was the terrible guilty party. I’m not sure why I was guilty; that was more
#. obscure. But someone had to be guilty, so I was it. Probably one thing was
#. that I was not being loving enough with Helen. I wasn’t impressed by the
#. fact that she was the Mother of God. This sort of thing went on for quite a

#. Context: One of the ways you could see their differences was that Helen was
#. overtly aggressive and Bill was passive aggressive; you always knew where
#. you stood with Helen. Also, Helen was much more aware of her anger than
#. Bill was. Helen was clear and she really never tried to justify it; I knew
#. her very, very well and it was kind of a given. She did not forgive Bill,
#. did not want to forgive Bill, would not forgive Bill, and she wasn’t saying
#. this was a spiritual position. Bill, on the other hand, was not aware. I
#. can give you one example that typified the whole issue. They had three
#. offices, an outer office and their two private offices, very secluded. You
#. have to picture this. We were sitting in Helen’s office; there was Helen
#. and her desk, I sat against the wall adjacent to her desk, and Bill would
#. be standing in the doorway, which he would do since every once in a while
#. he would go to his office and smoke. I was literally in the middle. Bill,
#. who did this more often than Helen, tried to put me in the middle [of their
#. battle]. I don’t remember what it was about, but they were at each other’s
#. throats. They were sniping at each other, the tension was building, and
#. Bill turned to me, asking me to support him against Helen, saying something
#. like, “Wouldn’t you agree, Kenneth?” It was obvious they were both
#. contributing, but Bill, I know, was not conscious of what he was doing. He
#. was being very snide; he was wonderful with words, a master. I finessed it
#. by saying, “Well, you’re both doing it,” which was true. Bill stormed out,
#. really angry; Helen looked at me and said, “Now you see what I’m up
#. against.” She meant Bill’s being passive aggressive and not knowing it;
#. that was very, very common. He was just not aware of his own anger and how
#. he was expressing it. Helen was just as much at fault, but she was right in
#. your face, she knew what she was doing. Helen was clear, Bill was not, and
#. that was often the problem. Since he was so good with words, he could make
#. a comment and not even know he was doing it. That particular morning
#. typified, I think, what their relationship was like.

#. Context: Basically, Bill blamed Helen for problems in the relationship.
#. Even after Helen died, I noticed there was a lot of bitterness. That’s what
#. Helen had trouble understanding. When she said Bill didn’t understand the
#. Course, that is part of what she meant. Somehow, he thought the
#. relationship was not healed because Helen wouldn’t change her mind. He was
#. always blaming her and feeling that if only Helen would change, he would be
#. healed. A lot of Bill’s and my discussions and our work together had to do
#. with that. That was a blind spot for Bill, making it impossible for him
#. because Helen was not going to change her mind. On the other hand, she did
#. not blame Bill for the relationship, she blamed him for just being Bill.
#. She was very clear about her own choices, how they kept the acrimony going.
#. She was brilliant, very insightful and basically said, “I’m not going to do
#. it [forgive him].” She would be very clear with people, “Do what I write,
#. not what I do.” We spent many, many hours—as an understatement—talking
#. about Bill and what she was doing. What really impressed me about Bill was
#. that, despite what he felt, there was a deep sense of commitment and trust
#. to whatever this was with Helen.[88]
