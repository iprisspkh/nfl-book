#. Context: After our first visit in Tiburon, a pattern emerged: Bill and I
#. met every couple of months, with phone calls in between. He would come to
#. Denver and stay with my family—my husband and two young boys—and in turn, I
#. would visit Tiburon and stay with him or, later, with Jerry, sometimes to
#. participate in planned events and sometimes for no reason. This schedule
#. continued for about three years. Early on, it felt surreal to watch him
#. sitting on our patio, listen to his tales, or conversely, be included in
#. his daily routine as he settled into California. He had dropped suddenly
#. and unexpectedly into the middle of my life, and it took a bit of getting
#. used to.

#. Context: During his visits to Denver, “socializing Bill” began in earnest.
#. I wish everyone could have seen him as he participated in that “normalizing
#. process.” He was so willing to explore. He especially enjoyed our sons—six
#. and eight when we met; he was fascinated by what little boys could do and
#. got such a kick out of their activities and friends. Although he had
#. studied, tested, and written about children in his professional life, he
#. had very little experience being around them in normal everyday life. As an
#. adult, he was basically unfamiliar with families or the myriad details and
#. responsibilities of family life. Bill would stand in the kitchen as I
#. prepared meals, with little ones running in and out, and often exclaim, “I
#. don’t know how you do all this!” It was business as usual; parents learn,
#. out of necessity, to multitask. He himself was a master at multitasking but
#. in very different areas of life.

#. was a source of great amusement—and perhaps some gratitude that he had
