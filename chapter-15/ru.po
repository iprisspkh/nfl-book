"If presence was a term universally ascribed to Bill, several noteworthy "
"subsets derive from it. A sentence from Dante’s Paradiso succinctly captures"
" so many people’s subjective experience of him: “You are my sire, said I: "
"you give me heart freely to speak my thought: above myself you raise "
"me.”[10] Or a more modern translation: “You give me full courage to speak; "
"you lift me until I am more than myself.”[11] That was Bill, and it most "
"fully articulates his greatest gift, the most noted aspect of his way of "
"being—his unsurpassed capacity to support and accept almost anyone or "
"anything. I say “almost,” because in his last decade there were still a few "
"loose ends of forgiveness not yet handled and some persons could still push "
"his buttons. Offering acceptance has a noticeable, substantive healing "
"effect both on those who give and receive it. It speaks in ways far more "
"compelling than words that we are not judged, that we are completely "
"acceptable as we are and deeply cared for. Within the light of Bill’s "
"acceptance, frantic or mindless thought could settle down, accompanied by a "
"deep sense of relief. Imagine no need to defend, impress, convince, or "
"dominate. People relaxed in his presence. Bill’s acceptance had the "
"instantaneous, profound effect of orienting people to their own innate "
"value, and the expansion was automatic. The Course speaks of the healing "
"effect that practicing forgiveness has on others:"
