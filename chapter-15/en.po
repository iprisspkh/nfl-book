#. Context: After our first visit in Tiburon, a pattern emerged: Bill and I
#. met every couple of months, with phone calls in between. He would come to
#. Denver and stay with my family—my husband and two young boys—and in turn, I
#. would visit Tiburon and stay with him or, later, with Jerry, sometimes to
#. participate in planned events and sometimes for no reason. This schedule
#. continued for about three years. Early on, it felt surreal to watch him
#. sitting on our patio, listen to his tales, or conversely, be included in
#. his daily routine as he settled into California. He had dropped suddenly
#. and unexpectedly into the middle of my life, and it took a bit of getting
#. used to.

#. Context: During his visits to Denver, “socializing Bill” began in earnest.
#. I wish everyone could have seen him as he participated in that “normalizing
#. process.” He was so willing to explore. He especially enjoyed our sons—six
#. and eight when we met; he was fascinated by what little boys could do and
#. got such a kick out of their activities and friends. Although he had
#. studied, tested, and written about children in his professional life, he
#. had very little experience being around them in normal everyday life. As an
#. adult, he was basically unfamiliar with families or the myriad details and
#. responsibilities of family life. Bill would stand in the kitchen as I
#. prepared meals, with little ones running in and out, and often exclaim, “I
#. don’t know how you do all this!” It was business as usual; parents learn,
#. out of necessity, to multitask. He himself was a master at multitasking but
#. in very different areas of life.

#. pain not fully acknowledged. Nothing specific prompted those episodes; it
#. was more a combination of things. We often spoke of his relationship with
#. Helen, with the Course, and the heaviness he carried about it all—the
#. burden of unexpressed life, repressed grief, hiding out. All of us hold
#. onto some secrets, wearying at the very least, and this was especially so
#. for Bill. He constantly lived a dual life: his academic career intermixed
#. with his hidden ACIM work, his unresolved love/hate relationship with
#. Helen, his knowledge of various secret CIA projects—very likely carried to
#. his grave—and of course, his never publicly acknowledged homosexual private

"Nothing specific prompted those episodes; it was more a combination of "
"things."

#. Context: Bill seemed to need, perhaps more than anything, some comfortable
#. time and space to assimilate his new life and slowly unwind. It was helpful
#. for him to be away from places where the roles of teacher, Course scribe,
#. learned professor, or anything else were thrust upon him. On occasion, when
#. we had our private space, he would break down and weep. I comforted him as
#. best I could, at the same time encouraging him to cry those tears so long
#. unshed—tears not so much over particulars, but a lifetime accumulation of
#. pain not fully acknowledged. Nothing specific prompted those episodes; it
#. was more a combination of things. We often spoke of his relationship with
#. Helen, with the Course, and the heaviness he carried about it all—the
#. burden of unexpressed life, repressed grief, hiding out. All of us hold
#. onto some secrets, wearying at the very least, and this was especially so
#. for Bill. He constantly lived a dual life: his academic career intermixed
#. with his hidden ACIM work, his unresolved love/hate relationship with
#. Helen, his knowledge of various secret CIA projects—very likely carried to
#. his grave—and of course, his never publicly acknowledged homosexual private
#. life. Thus, he could “hide out” in Denver, where almost no one had access
#. to him, and really let go.

#. she also assumed was his. He used to say that it seemed Helen would never

#. Context: Once when Bill was in Denver, we were in the front yard watching

#. yard. His paws were raw and bleeding as if he had had a very long, hard run
#. on concrete; he came straight toward us as if on purpose, clear about his
#. destination, then nearly collapsed. Bill had a very tender heart, was
#. concerned about the dog, as were we all, and asked several times what we
#. could do for him. We provided water, food, and a safe place to rest until
#. the owner, whose number was on his collar, returned our call that evening.
#. The dog was very friendly and, despite his recent experience, seemed
#. content to sit with us for several hours until his owner arrived to collect
#. him. Later, the owner told us the dog had been stolen from his backyard and
#. carried off for some unknown purpose. He had escaped his captors and was
#. trying to find his way back home; our neighborhood was approximately on the
