" was something about his presence that was so comforting and reassuring and "
"had nothing to do with what he said. I always felt an endearing sense of "
"calmness. He brought a sense of safety, which is the key point. People will "
"naturally gravitate toward individuals like that because they want that "
"sense of safety and peace and tranquility. It’s an unbelievably powerful "
"feeling. Most people have some hard edges; he seemed to have soft edges with"
" nothing that made you feel rough or constricted or uninviting. When you "
"were near him, everything was a little bit finer, a little more okay, more "
"resolved, none of which quite do justice to what it was like to be around "
"him. There was something about Bill that was almost angelic.[20]"
